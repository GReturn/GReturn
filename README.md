# Heyyo! ðŸ‘‹ 
It's G Return, but you can call me "Lin" or "Lindrew". It's not my real name though, so you don't have to bother finding me in Facebook. I like cheese. I've started programming not too long ago. I like cheese. I am still new to this working environment and I wish to balance my programming hobby and school, but I'm still having a hard time sorting it out. I like cheese.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:

  <li>How to talk to cats.</li>
  <li>How cheeses are made.</li>
  </ul>
