# <img width="26px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" /> Meet G Return // Lin 🦊
I'm part of the species with high intelligence and I have the XY chromosomes in my genetic data. I live in a rocky planet, which the locals may call "Earth" in the galaxy of Milky Way:  the neighboring galaxy of Andromeda, where my home planet could be located. The technological, economical, natural, and evolutionary advancements here on Earth piqued the interests of my ancestors. As their newborn descendants,  we are tasked to research and provide valuable data to those at home.

Hello, I'm G Return, but you can call me "Lin" or "Lindrew". It's not my real name though, so you don't have to bother finding me in Facebook. I like cheese. I've started programming not too long ago. I like cheese. I am still new to this working environment and I wish to balance my programming hobby and school, but I'm still having a hard time sorting it out. I like cheese. I like cheese. I like cheese.

<br/>*If I'm offline, I could either be dead or alive.*

 ### 💌 Note:
  
  The [Facial-Detection-via-OpenCV][face-opencv] is not a project that I am proud of creating. I simply used resources from websites and YouTube, and I feel miserable displaying it in here since it does not represent the best of me. However, I will not be taking it down since I want my future self to think that I was miserable. That feeling of misery will be a reminder to my future self that I truly strived hard to become a person he would be in the future. I just hope the person he became is a person he can be proud of.
